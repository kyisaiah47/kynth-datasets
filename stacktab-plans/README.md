# StackTab: every plan, its price, and the page the price was read from

One row per published plan: its base monthly price in USD, what the plan includes, the restrictions attached to it, and the URL the figure was read from with the date it was last checked.

## How it is measured

Each plan is re-checked on a schedule against its own pricing page. `price_status` says whether a number was readable at all, so a plan priced by sales contact is published as unpriced rather than as zero.

## What a citer needs to know

- `verified_at` is the last time the figure was confirmed against the page. `last_check_note` carries what happened when a check could not confirm it.
- `probes` are the strings the check looked for on the page. They are published so a disputed price can be re-derived.

Every cut is also a [GitHub release](https://github.com/kyisaiah47/kynth-datasets/releases) with the same files attached, so a
citation can pin the exact edition it quoted.
