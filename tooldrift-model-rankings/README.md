# ToolDrift: OpenRouter model usage rankings, captured daily

One row per model per ranking window per capture: its rank, the tokens and requests behind that rank, and its share of the window. The series shows which models the market actually routes work to, day by day.

## How it is measured

The public OpenRouter rankings are fetched on a schedule and stored as captured, one row per model per window. Nothing is smoothed, interpolated or revised after capture.

## What a citer needs to know

- A gap in `captured_on` is a day the capture did not run. It is left as a gap rather than filled, because an interpolated row in a ranking series is indistinguishable from a measured one once it is cited.
- `time_window` is OpenRouter's own window label, passed through unchanged.

Every cut is also a [GitHub release](https://github.com/kyisaiah47/compound-datasets/releases) with the same files attached, so a
citation can pin the exact edition it quoted.
