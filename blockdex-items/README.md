# BlockDex: every component, block and theme inside those registries

One row per item in every crawled registry: its type, its dependencies, the files it ships, its install command, and the dates it was first and last seen.

## How it is measured

Each registry is crawled and its items are read individually from the registry JSON, so an item that disappears between crawls is recorded as removed on a date rather than forgotten. Dependencies are the ones the item declares, not the ones a reader infers from its name.

## What a citer needs to know

- A `status` of `removed` with a `removed_on` date is an item that was there and is not any more. Those rows are the reason this dataset is more than a snapshot of a directory.
- The registry a row belongs to is `registry_slug`, which joins the registries dataset.

## Files

| File | Format | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `blockdex-items-2026-09-04.csv.gz` | CSV, gzipped | 5.4 MB |
| `blockdex-items-2026-09-04.json.gz` | JSON, gzipped | 6.0 MB |

Every cut is also a [GitHub release](https://github.com/kyisaiah47/compound-datasets/releases) with the same files attached, so a
citation can pin the exact edition it quoted.
