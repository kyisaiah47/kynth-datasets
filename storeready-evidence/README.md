# StoreReady: the cited evidence behind every verdict

One row per piece of evidence: which builder it is about, which claim it supports, the source it came from with its title and date, the quoted passage, and the HTTP status that source last returned.

## How it is measured

Evidence is a policy clause, a rejection thread or a shipped binary, recorded with the URL it was read from. Every source URL is re-checked and its status stored, so a citation resting on a page that has gone can be found rather than assumed live.

## What a citer needs to know

- `link_status` is the last HTTP status the source returned. A non-200 does not remove the evidence; it publishes the fact that the source moved.
- `quote` is the passage as it appeared. It is the primary source for the claim beside it.

| File | Format | Size |
|---|---|---|

| `storeready-evidence-2026-09-04.json` | JSON | 0.02 MB |

Every cut is also a [GitHub release](https://github.com/kyisaiah47/kynth-datasets/releases) with the same files attached, so a
citation can pin the exact edition it quoted.
