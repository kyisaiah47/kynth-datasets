# ToolDrift: the AI coding tools under watch

One row per AI coding tool watched nightly: its layer in the stack, its vendor, its licence and pricing model, its default model, and the GitHub maintenance signals beside the OpenRouter usage rank.

## How it is measured

Vendor changelogs, pricing pages and store rankings are fetched on a schedule and diffed against the previous capture. A price is recorded from the page that states it, and a page that has moved is followed and the redirect published rather than silently followed.

## What a citer needs to know

- `status` carries a tool that has been acquired, renamed or shut down. `acquired_by` and `status_changed_on` say which and when.
- `or_rank` and `or_tokens_week` come from OpenRouter's public rankings and are absent for a tool that does not route through it.

Every cut is also a [GitHub release](https://github.com/kyisaiah47/kynth-datasets/releases) with the same files attached, so a
citation can pin the exact edition it quoted.
