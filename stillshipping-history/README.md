# StillShipping: the daily verdict history

One row per tool per captured day: the verdict it held that day and the activity figures behind it. This is the series a reader needs to see a project slow down rather than to see where it stands today.

## How it is measured

A snapshot is written every night after the verdicts are recomputed, from the same GitHub API reads. Nothing is backfilled and nothing is revised, so a day that was measured wrong stays in the series and is corrected by a later day rather than overwritten.

## What a citer needs to know

- The series starts when a tool was first tracked, not when the project started. A short series means a recent addition.

## Files

| File | Format | Size |

| `stillshipping-history-2026-09-04.csv` | CSV | 6.9 MB |

Every cut is also a [GitHub release](https://github.com/kyisaiah47/kynth-datasets/releases) with the same files attached, so a
citation can pin the exact edition it quoted.
