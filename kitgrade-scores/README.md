## How it is measured

Each component is computed from the measured facts in the kits table by a versioned scoring function. `method_version` moves when the function changes, so a score from one edition is never silently compared with a score from another.

## What a citer needs to know

- A total is only comparable within one `method_version`. Comparing across versions is a comparison of two different functions.

Every cut is also a [GitHub release](https://github.com/kyisaiah47/kynth-datasets/releases) with the same files attached, so a
citation can pin the exact edition it quoted.
