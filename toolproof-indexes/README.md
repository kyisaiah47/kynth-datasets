# Toolproof: the nine indexes and what each one currently measures

One row per index under the Toolproof masthead: what it measures, the method behind it, the public endpoint its figures come from, and the headline figure that endpoint returned at the moment of the cut.

## How it is measured

Read from https://toolproof.kynth.studio/api/index.json, which builds itself by calling each index's own public stats endpoint at request time. An index that did not answer is kept in the file with ok=false and the reason it gave, because a consumer has to be able to tell a missing index from an index that measured nothing.

## What a citer needs to know

- The headline figures move between cuts. A citation of one of them should carry the cut date, which is in the filename and in `as_of`.
- `as_of` is the run that produced the figure. `fetched_at` is when this export read it. Those are different dates and both matter.

Every cut is also a [GitHub release](https://github.com/kyisaiah47/kynth-datasets/releases) with the same files attached, so a
citation can pin the exact edition it quoted.
