# StoreReady: AI app builders and whether their output ships

One row per AI app builder: what it actually outputs, whether the source leaves the platform, whether it submits to the store for you, what it costs, and the review verdict on whether the App Store accepts what it produces.

## How it is measured

Every verdict is attached to numbered evidence in the companion evidence dataset. A builder nobody has evidence for is published as unknown rather than given the benefit of the doubt.

## What a citer needs to know

- `risk_guidelines` names the App Review guideline clauses the output is exposed to, by number.
- A verdict is about the output, not about the company. It moves when the output changes.
