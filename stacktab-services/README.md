## How it is measured

The pricing page is fetched and the plan figures are read from the page that states them. Nothing is taken from a comparison site or a press release.

## What a citer needs to know

- `attrs` is JSON carrying the service-level facts that are not plan-level.

## Files

| File | Format | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `stacktab-services-2026-09-04.csv` | CSV | 0.01 MB |
| `stacktab-services-2026-09-04.json` | JSON | 0.01 MB |

Every cut is also a [GitHub release](https://github.com/kyisaiah47/compound-datasets/releases) with the same files attached, so a
citation can pin the exact edition it quoted.
