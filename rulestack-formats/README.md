# RuleStack: the agent config formats and what each one supports

One row per agent config format (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md and the rest): which tools read it, whether it supports frontmatter, globs, imports, nesting, multiple files and user scope, and the specification URL each of those was verified against.

## How it is measured

Every support flag is read from the format's own published specification or documentation, with the URL stored beside it and a verification date. Nothing is inferred from what a format is generally understood to do.

## What a citer needs to know

- `verified_at` is the date the support matrix was last confirmed against the spec. A format whose spec has moved since then may have changed.

## Files

| File | Format | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `rulestack-formats-2026-09-04.csv` | CSV | 0.01 MB |
| `rulestack-formats-2026-09-04.json` | JSON | 0.01 MB |

Every cut is also a [GitHub release](https://github.com/kyisaiah47/kynth-datasets/releases) with the same files attached, so a
citation can pin the exact edition it quoted.
