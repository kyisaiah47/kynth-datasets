# SkillWorks: Claude Code artefacts by category and kind

A structural census of the public Claude Code artefact ecosystem, aggregated to one row per category and artefact kind: how many listings the index holds, how many distinct repositories they came from, how many do not parse into something Claude Code could load, and the mean of the 0-100 score.

## How it is measured

Each listing's files are read from the repository that publishes them and scored on four weighted components. A listing that does not parse into a loadable artefact is counted as broken rather than dropped from the denominator, which is the number that decides whether a failure rate means anything.

## What a citer needs to know

- This is an aggregate. The underlying listing rows carry author handles at a scale nobody consented to being redistributed, so the row level is not published in any form.
- The ecosystem is heavily forked and vendored, so the same file is counted once per repository carrying it. The failure RATE is the citable figure; the population count is not a claim about how many distinct artefacts exist.

The aggregate is a database view, and this is its definition:

```sql
select coalesce(category, 'uncategorised') as category, kind, count(*) as listings,
       count(distinct repo_full_name) as repositories,
       count(*) filter (where works is false) as listings_that_do_not_load,
       count(*) filter (where works is true)  as listings_that_load,
       round(avg(score)::numeric, 2) as mean_score,
       count(*) filter (where official) as official,
       count(*) filter (where archived) as archived_repository,
       count(*) filter (where license is not null) as with_a_license,
       sum(stars) as total_repository_stars
from sw_listings group by 1, 2
```

Every cut is also a [GitHub release](https://github.com/kyisaiah47/kynth-datasets/releases) with the same files attached, so a
citation can pin the exact edition it quoted.
