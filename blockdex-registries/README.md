# BlockDex: every public shadcn registry

One row per public shadcn component registry: where it is served from, the repository behind it, its licence, how many items it holds and how many of those are free, and whether it is still there.

## How it is measured

Each registry is crawled on a schedule and its item list read from the registry JSON it serves rather than from its marketing page. A registry that stops answering is marked gone with the date, not deleted.

## What a citer needs to know

- `status` is `active` or `gone`. A gone registry keeps its row so a link that used to work can be explained.
- `access` is `free`, `paid`, `mixed` or `unknown`. Unknown means the registry does not state it in a form the crawl could read, and is not a guess.

## Files

| File | Format | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `blockdex-registries-2026-09-04.csv` | CSV | 0.38 MB |
| `blockdex-registries-2026-09-04.json` | JSON | 0.80 MB |

Every cut is also a [GitHub release](https://github.com/kyisaiah47/compound-datasets/releases) with the same files attached, so a
citation can pin the exact edition it quoted.
