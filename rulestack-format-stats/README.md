# RuleStack: how much each config format is actually used, day by day

One row per format per day: how many repositories carry it, how many config files were read, how long those files are at the median and the 90th percentile, and what share of them carry runnable commands or code.

## How it is measured

Config files are read out of public repositories and measured. The format shares are computed from the files found, never from a survey of what people say they use.

## What a citer needs to know

- `share_pct` is a share of the files read on that day, so it moves with the crawl as well as with the ecosystem.
- A day missing from the series is a day the crawl did not run.

## Files

| File | Format | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `rulestack-format-stats-2026-09-04.csv` | CSV | 0.01 MB |
| `rulestack-format-stats-2026-09-04.json` | JSON | 0.04 MB |

Every cut is also a [GitHub release](https://github.com/kyisaiah47/kynth-datasets/releases) with the same files attached, so a
citation can pin the exact edition it quoted.
